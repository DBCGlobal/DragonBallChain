DragonBallChain Introduction
=====================================

## :: What is DragonBallChain

Dragonball chain, referred to as DBC for short, adopts erc721 specification and can exist in the form of hybrid chain in jumpswap. Compared with the traditional NFT protocol, it is more intelligent and extensible. Dragonballchain not only supports mysterious box opening and card synthesis, but also supports Turing's complete smart contract function, token issuance and various value driven activities. In the future, we will also rely on DBC to issue 7 sub tokens for trading. With dragonballchain blockchain technology, ecosystem partners can build the most powerful and trusted guessing games and exchange digital assets, such as market linked assets, user issued assets and many other applications and services limited only by imagination.

## :: Where is DragonBallChain heading

Dragonballchain continues to develop and break something great. In the coming months, the Dragon bead chain will be stronger in many ways. The development of DBC will be divided into three stages:

1. Mysterious box and token issuing stage


2. Game ecology and value climbing stage


3. DBC planet and pan ecological landing stage

Dragonballchain will keep up with the latest blockchain technology and will not hesitate to innovate for the long-term success of the ecosystem.
